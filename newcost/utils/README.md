- compare\_arrays.m\\
Returns max of absolute value, element-wise comparison of
the vectorized version of the two arrays passed as parameters;
Note that sizes are not checked.

- G2R\_stiefel.m\\
(Very basic) Equivalent of codemeta's G2R function that is able to work
also with Stiefel "Rotations"

- G2T\_stiefel.m\\
(Very basic) Equivalent of codemeta's G2T function that is able to work
also with Stiefel "Translations"

- make\_oriented\_inc\_mat\_from\_edges.m\\
Make and return an oriented incidence matrix given a matrix of edges

- matUnstackH.m\\
Equivalent of matUnstack() for arrays that are stacked horizontally 
instead of vertically

- RT2G\_stiefel.m\\
(Very basic) Equivalent of codemeta's RT2G function that is able to work
also with Stiefel "Rotations and Translations", grouping them into a sort
of affine matrix
