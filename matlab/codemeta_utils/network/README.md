# Description
This repository contains all the code for various localization and formation control of networks.

# Contents
- bearingCluster: algorithm for finding rigid components
- bearingLocalization: mostly proof of concept code. Will contain localization using matrix embedding.
- bearingNetwork: formation control algorithms.
- consensus: will be removed.
- localization: algorithms for 3-D localization using different inputs.
- locSeg, rigidLocalizationSegmentation: algorithm for finding rigid compoents with general constraints. No rigorous results.
- utilities: as the name says.

# TODO
Remove consensus folder. Merge locSeg and rigidLocalizationSegmentation. Clean up bearingLocalization.
